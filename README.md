Added themes and icons. Some themes and icons sets I created, but the Adapta themes are from the AUR.

I store my suckless builds in .config, for a cleaner home directory.
I also have aliases for quick compilation after config.h editing, my .zshrc file sources the .aliases.zsh file. Below are a patch count on each suckless tool/program

Added pywal support for all suckless programs.
For custom pywal colors done easily, cd into ~/.cache/wal/, then run "sed -i 's/current-hex-color/new-hex-color/g' color*".

DWM - 18 patches (alpha, attachaside, bottomstack, centeredmaster, cyclelayouts, fibonacci, fullgaps, gridmode, moveresize, noborder, restartsig, titlecolor, statuscolors, sticky, warp, savefloats, hide inactive, pertag) 

ST - 5 patches (alpha, boxdraw, clipboard, scrollback, spoiler)

DMENU - 4 patches (fuzzymatch, mousesupport, prefixcompletion-flag, xyw)
