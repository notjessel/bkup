Added themes and icons. Some themes and icons sets I created, but the Adapta themes are from the AUR.

I store my suckless builds in .config, for a cleaner home directory.
I also have aliases for quick compilation after config.h editing, my .zshrc file sources the .aliases.zsh file. Below are a patch count on each suckless tool/program

DWM - 18 patches (alpha, attachaside, bottomstack, centeredmaster, cyclelayouts, fibonacci, fullgaps, gridmode, moveresize, noborder, restartsig, titlecolor, statuscolors, sticky, warp, savefloats, hide inactive, pertag) 

ST - 5 patches (alpha, boxdraw, clipboard, scrollback, spoiler)

DMENU - 4 patches (fuzzymatch, mousesupport, prefixcompletion-flag, xyw)

added mpd and ncmpcpp config

added mpd status script I wrote for dwmblocks
